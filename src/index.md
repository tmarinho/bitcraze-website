The Crazyflie is ideal for many areas of research. The source code and hardware
is open, making it possible to tap into any
part of the system for complete control and full flexibility. New hardware or sensors can be added
through the versatile expansion ports, enabling the addition of the latest sensors.
The small size and light weight reduces the need for safety equipment and increases
productvity."

portalexample="
Example applications: autonomous flight, path finding, sensor fusion, swarms and
environment scanning"

{% include index-portal-right.html portalheader="Used in education" portalimg="/images/frontpage/front-page-portal-pic-3.jpg" portaltext="
The popularity of quadcopters makes the Crazyflie a perfect tool for higher education.
The source code is open making it easy to investigate or modify any part of the system,
giving the students a direct connection from theory to the real world."

portalexample="Examples areas: realtime systems, automatic control and signal processing"

{% include index-portal-left.html portalheader="Used in development" portalimg="/images/frontpage/front-page-portal-pic-1.jpg" portaltext="
Prototype your flying application in the comfort of your lab and usual development
environment on a small and handy Crazyflie. Add sensors and other hardware as needed
through the expansion ports. When everything is tested and working as expected,
move to a larger platform and go outdoors.
Try out if your favourite programming language is doing well for drones
or investigate how to use sensor data to understand the real world."

portaltext="Love to fly? Like to tinker with toys? Want to modify and explore? Hate limitations and closed
systems? The Crazyflie is for you!

Add decks for light and sound effects, or why not build your own deck? Create a
skin to make it look like your favourite flying creature or add a camera and
do First Person Flying. Use the Crazyflie on a bigger quadcopter frame and build
the optimal drone, tailored for your needs."

portalexample="Example applications: flying for fun, FPV racing, flying art, application skinning and explore quadcopters"
